# HiraganaLearningApp
Application for beginner learners of Hiragana
I started to develop this application for two reasons: First to help a younger friend who has been interested in learning Japanese.  I see him often writing hiragana on paper and I thought it would be helpful to automate and gamify his learning experience.  Second was for myself.  I have never created a python application that used a GUI, so this was a chance for me to learn Tkinter and Pygame, neither of which I've used before.
